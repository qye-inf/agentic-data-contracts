"""Sweep driver: resumable, budget-capped, one JSONL row per unit of work.

This is the component that spends real money, so its guards matter as much
as its logic. THE CENTRAL INVARIANT, stated once, that every rule below
exists to uphold:

    ONCE A PRICED ROW EXISTS, IT REACHES DISK BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE MAY
    THROW.

`run_task_fn` returning (or `_construction_error_row` building a
substitute) is the moment a row becomes "priced" — real spend, or a
deliberate pessimistic guard charge, is now a fact that must be recorded.

STRUCTURAL, NOT A SERIES OF GUARDED STATEMENTS: there is exactly ONE site
in `sweep`'s loop body that writes a row (`_safe_json_dumps` + `fh.write`),
and every step between "`row` exists" and that site — the integrity check,
pricing validation — COLLECTS its failure onto the row (an `integrity_error`
or `pricing_error` note, a normalized/pessimistic value swapped in) instead
of raising through it. A collected exception, if any, is held in
`pending_exc` and only gets to propagate AFTER the write, the flush, and
the `spent`/`real_spent` update. This was gotten wrong THREE times already
in this one component, at three different frames, each reproducing the
identical signature (a resumed sweep burning real money while
`spent_so_far`/rows-on-disk stayed at zero) via a different mechanism:

  1. `run_task_fn`'s whole outcome was treated as unpriced on ANY
     exception (fixed by `AgentConstructionError`'s narrowing, below, plus
     `run_task`'s own guarded post-call tail in `dce/agent.py`).
  2. The loop calling it had the identical problem one frame later:
     `check_and_restore` itself raising, or `json.dumps` raising,
     discarded an already-priced row the same way (fixed by writing
     before re-raising, and by `_safe_json_dumps`'s fallback layers).
  3. The FIX for (2) still left two statements between the two guarded
     calls unguarded: `_validated_usd(row["usd"], ...)` and
     `_validated_usd(row["usd_guard"], ...)` raised and lost the row on a
     `Decimal`, a NaN, an infinite value, or a missing key — the identical
     bug, one frame further in, dressed as "validate before writing"
     rather than "guard this specific call". Fixed by making pricing
     validation collect-and-normalize (see `_priced_or_pessimistic`)
     instead of raise-and-lose, using the SAME policy `check_and_restore`
     failures already got, rather than the opposite one.

The regression pin for this is
`test_sweep_lands_the_row_no_matter_what_fails_between_return_and_write`, a
parametrized test that injects a failure at every known point in this
sequence (a bad `usd`, a bad `usd_guard`, a non-`str` dict key, a circular
reference, `check_and_restore` raising) and asserts the row always lands —
so a fifth frame introduced later has to explicitly break a test, not slip
past silently the way the first three did.

A FULL DISK IS HANDLED ON BOTH SIDES, not documented away: `fh.write`/
`fh.flush` failing dumps the serialized row to stderr before re-raising
(so a priced row is recoverable by hand from the log), and `_read_rows`
forgives an unparseable FINAL line — a torn tail is what a killed or
out-of-space append leaves behind, and raising on it used to make the
entire accumulated results file unreadable to every reader at once,
turning a one-row loss into a dead paid sweep. A corrupt line anywhere
but the last still raises. The READ side's forgiveness has a WRITE side
counterpart, `_repair_torn_tail`, called once before `sweep`'s append loop
opens `out`: `out.open("a")` appends onto whatever bytes are already
there, torn tail included, which MERGES the next row onto it instead of
starting a fresh line — silently swallowing that row (it reads back as
torn again, so the unit is re-attempted and re-paid forever) and then, on
the very next resume, pushing the still-corrupt merged line off the tail
entirely, which bricks every reader for the whole file instead of just
one row. `_repair_torn_tail` truncates a genuinely torn tail before the
first append (matching what the read side already forgives) rather than
appending onto it.

"REACHES DISK" IS NOW LITERAL, AND WAS NOT ALWAYS. `flush()` alone hands
the bytes to the OS page cache, which survives THIS PROCESS dying (a
crash, a `raise`, `SIGKILL` — verified by probe) but not the MACHINE
dying before that cache is written out. Since the sweep is meant to run
unattended on a VPS, where the machine is exactly what dies, every write
is followed by `os.fsync`. Rows arrive about once a minute per worker,
so there was no throughput argument for batching it. Two residual
edges, both stated rather than papered over: on macOS `fsync` does not
force the drive's own cache (`F_FULLFSYNC` would), so a laptop run keeps
the weaker guarantee; and `fsync` protects the file's CONTENT, not the
file — operator error, a bad disk, or a bug that truncates it are
covered instead by the periodic side copy (`SNAPSHOT_EVERY_ROWS`),
written to a temp name and `os.replace`d so the backup is never itself
half-written.

ONE SWEEP PER RESULTS FILE, ENFORCED. `sweep` holds an `O_EXCL` lock on
`<out>.lock` for its whole duration (`dce/lockfile.py`). Two concurrent
sweeps were reproduced here by accident: the results file came through
intact — every row landed, nothing was torn, `latest_rows` dedupes —
which is exactly what makes it dangerous, because nothing in the output
says it happened. What does not survive is the money (72 units paid for
twice) and `db_corrupted`: both instances share `<db>.working`, so one's
`make_working_copy` copies the pristine database over a file the other
holds a live DuckDB connection on, and the resulting corruption is
attributed to an arm that did nothing. An auto-restarting supervisor is
precisely the setting where this happens unwatched.

EXIT CODE TAXONOMY (`main()`, via `_exit_code_for` plus one path it does
NOT cover):

  * `0` — completed cleanly.
  * `1` — an UNCAUGHT exception propagated out of `main()` entirely (e.g.
    a `check_and_restore` failure with no working `except` above it, or
    genuinely any other bug) — Python's own default for an uncaught
    exception, not something `_exit_code_for` assigns. No final `spent`
    line is printed in this case: the traceback is the last thing on
    stderr, and the row(s) already written are the only record of what
    happened up to that point.
  * `2` — `SweepResult.truncated`: the spend cap would have been exceeded.
  * `3` — `SweepResult.circuit_broken`: too many consecutive construction
    failures across different units.
  * `4` — `SweepResult.connection_leaked`: a DuckDB connection failed to
    close; the working copy's integrity substrate can no longer be
    trusted for this invocation.

  * WORKING COPY, ALWAYS. Arms `schema_only` and `manual_prompt` are
    ungoverned — nothing stops either from issuing `DROP TABLE` against
    whatever file it is pointed at (see `dce/arms.py`'s module docstring,
    CALL ORDER). `sweep` makes exactly one working copy per process
    (`make_working_copy`) and hands every arm the *copy*, never the
    pristine file, then runs `check_and_restore` after each task — once
    `run_task` has closed its own arm, which is what makes the check valid.
    Left on disk once the sweep finishes (deliberately — a corrupted-DB row
    is worth being able to inspect post-mortem); the next invocation just
    overwrites it via `make_working_copy` again, so nothing accumulates.
  * A CORRUPTED DB IS A FINDING, NOT A CRASH — AND A FAILED CHECK IS A
    DIFFERENT FINDING, NOT A LOST ROW. `check_and_restore` itself can raise
    (a real `PermissionError` from `_sha256`, a full disk on the repair
    `copyfile`) — it is not an exotic caller: corruption is the EXPECTED
    outcome for the ungoverned arms this experiment studies, so its
    `unlink` + multi-MB `copyfile` path runs often, and its triggers
    (unreadable pristine file, full disk) are persistent, which is
    precisely when a resuming wrapper hits it again and again. Per the
    invariant above, a `check_and_restore` failure still gets the row
    written — `db_corrupted: None` (unknown, not `False`) plus an
    `integrity_error` note — with `spent` updated, and ONLY THEN
    re-raises, so the sweep still stops loudly on a persistent environment
    problem without losing the accounting for the call that already
    happened.
  * A LEAKED CONNECTION STOPS THE SWEEP — IT DOES NOT JUST FLAG ONE ROW.
    `run_task`'s `setup.close()` runs inside its own `try/except`, so a
    close failure there no longer replaces a good row — but it must not be
    SILENT either: if the connection did not actually close, this sweep's
    `check_and_restore` call is not a valid check (see `dce/arms.py`'s CALL
    ORDER — a check against a live connection can report a repair that
    does not survive that connection's later checkpoint-on-close). Worse,
    a live leaked connection can keep mutating the SAME working copy
    underneath whatever runs next, so EVERY later task's check in this
    sweep would be equally untrustworthy — and each of those later rows
    would carry a `db_corrupted` value that looks just as authoritative as
    a real one. The experiment's headline governance finding is "did an
    ungoverned arm mutate the warehouse", so a stream of unreliable
    `db_corrupted` values is worse than no sweep at all. `run_task` stamps
    `close_error` onto the row when this happens; `sweep` writes that row
    (`db_corrupted: None`, the invariant above still holds) and then STOPS
    THE WHOLE SWEEP — a distinct outcome (`SweepResult.connection_leaked`,
    a distinct exit code) from a budget truncation or a circuit break.
    Resume already works, so restarting in a fresh process (a fresh
    working copy) loses nothing but the one task in flight; stopping
    loudly on a rare failure is far cheaper than silently producing rows
    nobody can trust.
  * A CONSTRUCTION FAILURE IS A FINDING, NOT A CRASH — AND IT IS THE *ONLY*
    THING THAT CAN STILL ESCAPE `run_task` UNPRICED. `run_task` raises
    `dce.agent.AgentConstructionError` when its agent factory fails (e.g. a
    missing `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), before any billable call was made; `sweep`
    catches exactly that type and nothing else, writing a row with
    `verdict: "construction_error"`. Anything else `run_task_fn` raises is a
    real bug and is left to propagate and stop the sweep loudly — `run_task`
    itself guards its whole post-call tail so a bug there returns a priced
    row instead of raising (see `dce/agent.py`'s `_priced_fallback_row`);
    only agent construction is still allowed to raise, and only because
    nothing billable has happened yet when it does. Retries are bounded on
    TWO levels, not one:
      - Per-key: `completed_keys` stops retrying a unit after
        `MAX_CONSTRUCTION_ATTEMPTS` TRAILING `construction_error` rows
        (consecutive at the END of that key's history, not a lifetime
        total — a key that once failed, then succeeded, then failed again
        must not be given up on after that one fresh failure) and treats
        it as terminal — "cheap twice, then loud" — and `gave_up_keys` lets
        `main()` warn about exactly which units that happened to.
      - Sweep-wide: `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` CONSECUTIVE
        `construction_error` outcomes, across however many DIFFERENT keys,
        stops the whole sweep immediately. A missing `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
        fails every unit identically; without this, per-key bounding alone
        would still write up to `len(tasks) x len(arms) x len(models) x
        MAX_CONSTRUCTION_ATTEMPTS` phantom-priced rows before the SPEND cap
        (not the circuit breaker) finally noticed — 2,436 rows and ~$446 of
        guard-ledger charges at 406 tasks x 3 arms, all before
        `gave_up_keys` is what an operator happens to check.
  * SEPARATE REAL SPEND FROM GUARD SPEND. Pricing a `construction_error`
    pessimistically is right for the CAP (an unknown-cost failure must not
    read as free) but wrong for the LEDGER (a genuine construction failure
    spent nothing real). Every row therefore carries two fields: `usd`
    (what was actually billed — 0.0 for a genuine `construction_error`) and
    `usd_guard` (what the spend cap counts — the pessimistic ceiling for a
    `construction_error`, identical to `usd` for every other verdict, since
    a real call really did happen). `spent_so_far` sums `usd_guard` — the
    cap's own ledger; `real_spent_so_far` sums `usd` — what to actually
    report as spent. `main()` prints the real figure and treats the guard
    figure as bookkeeping, not an accounting claim.
  * THE SPEND CAP BOUNDS THE EXPERIMENT, NOT ONE PROCESS. `sweep` seeds its
    running total from `spent_so_far(out)` — the `usd_guard` already banked
    by every prior invocation against the same `out` file — because resume
    is the headline feature and a cap that resets to $0 on every restart is
    no cap at all under a crash loop or a naive retry wrapper. A row's
    `usd`/`usd_guard` are VALIDATED (a real, finite, non-negative number,
    or `None` treated as 0.0 — never a string, a `Decimal`, a bool, a
    negative figure, NaN, or `float("inf")`) before it contributes to
    either total — but an invalid value is NORMALIZED to the pessimistic
    per-model ceiling with a `pricing_error` note (see
    `_priced_or_pessimistic`), not raised and discarded: the row still
    reaches disk (the central invariant above) either way, so an invalid
    or un-priced value can no longer land on disk looking like a free,
    permanently-done unit, and it no longer costs the row itself to say
    so.
  * THE RESERVATION IS A REAL CEILING, NOT A GUESS, AND IT COVERS A WHOLE
    TASK. Before any observation for a given model, `sweep` reserves
    `dce.agent._token_budget_usd(model)` — the true worst case the runaway
    token guard allows, not a hand-picked dollar figure. Once a model HAS
    been observed, the reservation is the larger of that ceiling and the max
    (not mean) of what it has actually cost so far — never just the
    observed max alone, which would let one cheap early call collapse the
    reservation for every later, possibly-worst-case call (measured: an 82%
    budget overrun this way). The reservation covers an entire task's (arm,
    model) group at once and is checked before the first call in that
    group, so a truncation always lands on a task boundary: a
    resumed/paired analysis never has to discard a half-finished task.
  * A RETRIED UNIT ACCUMULATES ROWS; SCORING MUST DEDUPE. Every attempt at a
    (task_id, arm, model) key appends a new row to `out` rather than
    replacing the old one — `spent_so_far`/`completed_keys`/the reserve
    estimator all deliberately want every row (cumulative real spend,
    accurate retry counts), but a *scorer* wants each unit counted exactly
    once, by its most recent outcome. `latest_rows(out)` returns exactly
    that (last row per key wins); every downstream reader that scores this
    file — Task 9's accuracy/McNemar calculations included — MUST use it
    rather than iterating `out` directly, or a stale `construction_error`
    row sitting earlier in the file gets silently counted as a wrong answer
    on top of the real, later outcome.

CONCURRENCY (`--workers N`, default 1). `sweep` runs N TASK GROUPS at once
on N threads. The unit of dispatch is the whole group (every arm x model for
one task), never an individual unit, which is what preserves two properties
the serial loop got for free: a truncation still lands on a task boundary (so
a paired analysis never has a half-finished task), and one task's arms still
share one copy of the database.

Four pieces of state became shared, and each is handled explicitly rather
than hoped about:

  * THE RESULTS FILE. Still exactly ONE write site, now inside
    `_SweepLedger.record`, which holds the lock across write + flush +
    spend update. An unsynchronized `write`/`flush` interleaves partial
    lines, and a torn line in the MIDDLE of the file (not the tail) is the
    one corruption `_read_rows` deliberately refuses to forgive — it would
    brick every reader of the whole paid sweep at once.
  * THE SPEND LEDGER. Serially, `spent` alone was a sufficient basis for the
    cap check because nothing was ever in flight. With N groups running,
    N-1 of them have spent money no row has banked yet, so the reservation
    is now HELD from dispatch to completion (`_SweepLedger.reserved`) and
    the check is `spent + reserved + this group`. This double-counts a
    running group; the error is always toward stopping early, which is the
    only direction a spend guard may be wrong in.
  * THE WORKING COPY — the one that is not merely a data race. Each worker
    gets its OWN copy (`<db>.working`, `<db>.working-1`, ...). One shared
    copy would put `check_and_restore`'s whole-file repair `copyfile` in the
    middle of another worker's live query, and would destroy the
    attribution of `db_corrupted` to the arm that caused it — and
    `db_corrupted` IS this experiment's headline governance finding, so a
    shared copy would be wrong, not just flaky.
  * THE STOP CONDITIONS. A worker cannot `break` its peers, so budget
    truncation, the circuit breaker, a leaked connection, and a real bug all
    set a `threading.Event` that every worker checks before pulling more
    work. Groups already in flight run to completion and their rows land:
    stopping must never cost a row that has already been paid for. An
    exception that must stop the sweep is parked on the ledger and re-raised
    by `sweep` after the pool drains, preserving the serial ordering (write,
    flush, spend update, THEN propagate).

The circuit breaker's "consecutive" now means consecutive in COMPLETION
order, which under concurrency is not dispatch order. That is still the
right reading: it asks whether the last N things that finished were all
construction failures, which is exactly the systemic-failure signal (a
missing `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` fails every unit identically) it exists to
catch.

At `workers=1` every behaviour above — including the order rows are written
in — is identical to the serial sweep this replaced.

Two gaps recorded here as deliberately unfixed, not silently tolerated —
see `dce/agent.py`'s module docstring for the full detail on both:

  * `KeyboardInterrupt` during a live model call escapes everything in
    both this module and `run_task` (measured: 5 interrupts, ~$6.00 real
    spend, 0 rows). Accepted: it is user-initiated, and a sweep the
    operator is actively killing does not need its own bookkeeping to
    survive the kill.
  * `TOKEN_BUDGET` has roughly 25% slack against the true per-request
    ceiling, because `total_tokens_limit` is only checked BETWEEN requests.

      * The SECOND resume appends again, pushing that still-corrupt merged
        line off the tail — it is no longer the LAST line, so `_read_rows`
        now RAISES on it ("a corrupt line anywhere but the last still
        raises"), bricking every reader (`spent_so_far`, `completed_keys`,
        `dce.stats.report`, ...) for the whole file, not just the one row.

    This function runs once, before `sweep`'s append loop opens `out`, and
    repairs the file to match what `_read_rows` already treats it as:

      * If the file's last line, read in isolation, parses as valid JSON,
        it is simply missing a trailing newline (e.g. a hand-edited file,
        or one written before this repair existed) — nothing is torn or
        lost, so only a newline is appended.
      * If it does not parse, it IS the torn tail. It is truncated off
        entirely (not left in place) — matching `_read_rows` forgiving it
        on the read side, so the next row `sweep` appends starts the file's
        new last line instead of merging onto a dead one, and the file
        stays fully parseable across any number of resumes.

    Truncating (rather than only inserting a separating newline) is the
    right call here specifically because a torn line, once anything is
    appended after it, permanently stops being "the last line" — the one
    exemption `_read_rows` grants. Leaving the torn bytes in place while
    still appending would just move today's data loss (one swallowed row)
    into tomorrow's brick (every reader raising) one resume later; removing
    them is what makes the exemption's premise ("only the tail is ever
    torn") stay true after this repair.

      1. Plain `json.dumps(row)`.
      2. `default=repr` — covers a VALUE `json` doesn't natively know how
         to serialize (an exception object, a custom class instance, ...).
         Does NOT cover a non-`str`-coercible dict KEY (`json` raises

         `default` only ever runs on values) or a circular reference
         (`json` detects the cycle and raises `ValueError` internally,
         again before `default` gets a say).
      3. A minimal envelope built from `str(row)` — Python's `str`/`repr`
         on a `dict` has its own built-in cycle guard (renders `{...}` for
         a self-reference rather than recursing or raising), and places no
         constraint on key types at all, so this covers both gaps layer 2
         leaves open.

    THE ENVELOPE MUST CARRY THE PRICE, not merely enough to find the line.
    Layer 3 landing a row that reads `$0.00` is the SAME failure this
    module's central invariant exists to prevent, one layer deeper: a
    resumed sweep really spent the money, `spent_so_far` summed `0.0`, and
    `--max-spend` stopped binding at all (reproduced: 20 resumes, $24.00
    real, 20 rows on disk, `spent_so_far` $0.00). So `usd` and `usd_guard`
    are carried, normalized through `_priced_or_pessimistic` exactly as the
    write site itself normalizes them — by the time `sweep` calls this,
    both are already validated finite floats, and a pessimistic ceiling is
    the right answer for any other caller's malformed row.

    `level` and `db_corrupted` are carried for the same reason one layer
    out: without `level`, `dce.stats.accuracy_by(rows, "level")` buckets
    the row as `"unknown"` and the stratum tables silently misreport;
    without `db_corrupted`, the experiment's HEADLINE governance finding
    is misattributed (a `True` reads as absent, i.e. "check never ran").

    The four identifying fields are `str()`-coerced and ALWAYS present,
    never filtered on `isinstance`. A non-`str` `task_id` used to make the
    envelope omit the key entirely, after which `latest_rows` and
    `completed_keys` — which index `row["task_id"]` — raised `KeyError` on
    the whole file, taking down every future resume AND `dce.stats.report`.

class _SweepLedger:
    """Every piece of state `sweep`'s workers share, behind ONE lock.

    Concurrency does not relax the module's central invariant — a priced row
    still reaches disk before anything else may throw — it only moves the
    enforcement point. `record` IS the one write site, and it holds the lock
    across the write, the flush, and the spend/observation update, so no two
    workers can interleave a partial line or lose an update to a read-modify-
    write race on `spent`.

    THE RESERVATION IS NOW HELD, NOT JUST COMPUTED. Serially, `sweep` reserved
    one task group, ran it, banked the cost, and reserved the next: `spent`
    alone was a sufficient basis for the check because nothing was ever in
    flight. With `workers` groups running at once, `workers - 1` of them have
    spent real money that no row has banked yet, so a guard reading `spent`
    alone would admit `workers` groups against a budget for one. `reserved`
    holds each in-flight group's ceiling from dispatch (`try_reserve`) to
    completion (`release`), and the check is against `spent + reserved`.

    That deliberately DOUBLE-COUNTS a group while it runs: its rows bank into
    `spent` as they land while its reservation is still held. The error is
    always in the conservative direction — the sweep stops slightly early,
    never slightly over — which is the only direction a spend guard is allowed
    to be wrong in.

    STOPPING IS A FLAG, NOT A `break`. The serial loop broke out of two nested
    `for`s. A worker cannot break its peers, so every stop condition (budget,
    circuit breaker, leaked connection, a real bug) sets `stop`, which every
    worker checks before pulling more work. Groups already in flight run to
    completion and their rows land — stopping the sweep must never cost a row
    that has already been paid for.

        if this group must not run.

        The reservation covers the entire group and is taken before the
        group's first call, so a truncation always lands on a task boundary
        and a paired analysis never has to discard a half-finished task —
        the same property the serial loop had, for the same reason.

        "DOES NOT FIT" AND "BUDGET EXHAUSTED" ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS, AND
        CONFLATING THEM ENDS THE SWEEP EARLY. Serially they were the same
        thing: nothing was ever in flight, so a group that did not fit could
        never fit. Concurrently, a group that does not fit against
        `spent + reserved` may fit perfectly well once another group's
        reservation is released — reservations are worst-case ceilings and
        real costs run ~100x smaller, so on a budget that would in fact fund
        hundreds more sequential groups, the Nth worker routinely fails this
        check simply because N-1 ceilings are already held. Calling that
        truncation would end the whole sweep at `workers - 1` groups.

        So: refuse permanently ONLY when nothing is in flight to wait for
        (`reserved == 0`) — which is exactly the serial condition, and why
        `workers=1` behaves identically. Otherwise wait for a release and
        re-check. Termination is not at risk: every holder eventually
        releases, and the last release leaves `reserved == 0`, which forces
