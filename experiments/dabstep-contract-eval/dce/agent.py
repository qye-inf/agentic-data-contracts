"""Run one (task, arm, model) and return a fully provenanced result row.

`run_task` guarantees that once the billable model call has happened (or a
cap has tripped), it returns — it does not raise. The only exception it
still lets propagate is `AgentConstructionError`, and only because nothing
billable has happened yet when that one fires. Two known, deliberately
unfixed gaps in that guarantee, recorded here rather than silently
tolerated:

  * `KeyboardInterrupt` during a live model call escapes everything —
    `run_sync` itself, the guarded tail, even `setup.close()`'s own
    `try/except Exception` (which does not catch `BaseException`
    subclasses). Measured: 5 interrupted calls burned ~$6.00 in real spend
    and produced 0 rows. This is accepted as-is: an interrupt is
    user-initiated, and a sweep the operator is actively killing does not
    need its own resume bookkeeping to survive the kill — but it means an
    operator who Ctrl-C's a running sweep should not assume `spent_so_far`
    reflects everything that was actually billed up to that point.
  * `TOKEN_BUDGET` (the runaway guard) has slack against the TRUE
    request-level ceiling: `UsageLimits.total_tokens_limit` is checked only
    BETWEEN requests (see `PER_REQUEST_INPUT_TOKEN_CAP`'s own note on the
    same gap), so one in-flight request can land up to roughly
    `PER_REQUEST_INPUT_TOKEN_CAP` (a quarter of `TOKEN_BUDGET`) over the
    nominal cap before the NEXT request is what actually stops. ~25% slack
    is accepted as part of `TOKEN_BUDGET`'s deliberately generous sizing
    (see its own module-level comment), not closed here.

MAX_TOOL_CALLS: int = 40

# RAISED FROM 25 AFTER THE FIRST SMOKE RUN (F2, see
# `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-dabstep-smoke-findings.md`). On the first
# hard task attempted, TWO of three arms exhausted the budget and returned an
# empty answer: a `hit_limit` row is unscoreable, so it costs full price and
# contributes nothing to accuracy. Raising the cap alone would not fix that —
# a bigger budget still ends in the same unscoreable row when it runs out —
# which is why `_force_final_answer` below exists alongside it.

# pydantic-ai's own current default for `UsageLimits.request_limit`, made
# explicit rather than inherited — verified against the installed library in
# `tests/test_agent.py`'s API-shape guards — so a future pydantic-ai release
# that changes its default cannot silently change how many model turns one
# task gets, and so the value in force is visible and can be stamped into
# the result row (see `build_result_row`'s `request_limit` field) instead of
# being an invisible library default.
REQUEST_LIMIT: int = 50

# N2's fix: `total_tokens_limit` is only checked BETWEEN requests, so nothing
# by itself stops one enormous single request. Demonstrated overshoot before
# these existed: a 10,000-row `payments` result serialising to ~429k tokens
# (see `dce/arms.py`'s `MAX_ROWS`, since lowered to 1,000 for the same
# reason) became the next request's input in full, costing ~$0.86 on
# `gpt-5.6-sol` alone — $1.80 total against a $0.25 cap that request never
# got a chance to enforce because it only fires between requests, not within
# one. Two closures, both applied identically to every arm/model so neither
# is a confound:
#
#   * `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST` bounds one model turn's OUTPUT via
#     `ModelSettings(max_tokens=...)` — previously unset, so a single
#     response (reasoning tokens included) was unbounded.
#   * `UsageLimits.per_request_input_tokens_limit` (set in `run_task` as
#     `PER_REQUEST_INPUT_TOKEN_CAP`, below) bounds one request's INPUT.
#
# The output bound must clear a reasoning model's reasoning, not just its
# answer — see the F1 note directly below, which is why 4,000 was wrong.
MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST: int = 64_000
# RAISED AGAIN, 16,000 -> 64,000, AND THIS TIME THE FAILURE WAS ARM-DEPENDENT
# AND LARGE. F1 raised it 4,000 -> 16,000 after the same error killed one arm
# of the first smoke run. 16,000 was sized against `glm-5.3-flash`, which
# reasons ~380 tokens per run; it survived that sweep at 3 errors in 1,604
# rows (0.2%). `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` reasons two orders of magnitude
# harder: measured on the first 15 rows of its sweep, a single `schema_only`
# run spent 36,155 reasoning tokens across 23 turns, and single requests blew
# past 16,000 on their own.
#
# The resulting error rate was 3 of 7 `schema_only` rows and ZERO in the
# other three arms. That asymmetry is the whole problem, and it is not
# subtle: an arm with no context flounders, reasons enormously, and dies on a
# HARNESS parameter — while the arms carrying context finish comfortably. An
# `error` row scores as wrong, so leaving the cap here would have handed the
# contract arm a win manufactured by our own configuration, in exactly the
# direction that flatters this library. That is the same class of mistake as
# F12, where a stricter-than-official scorer produced a false positive in our
# favour.
#
# 64,000 is chosen against evidence rather than doubled by reflex: the
# largest WHOLE-RUN output observed on this model is 38,983 tokens across 23
# turns, so a single request reaching 64,000 would be extraordinary. It stays
# far below the pinned endpoint's 384,000 ceiling, so it is still a real
# per-request bound rather than a formality, and `TOKEN_BUDGET` plus
# `tool_calls_limit` remain the actual runaway guards.
#
# THE GENERAL LESSON, worth carrying beyond this experiment: a fixed output
# cap is not model-independent. It must clear the reasoning volume of the
# most reasoning-hungry (model, arm) pair in the comparison, and the arm that
# needs the most reasoning is reliably the one with the least context. Sized
# to one model, it silently becomes a confound on the next.

# RAISED FROM 4,000 AFTER THE FIRST SMOKE RUN (F1). The old value assumed
# "4,000 output tokens is generous for a data-analyst answer with some
# reasoning attached". That is false for a reasoning model: reasoning tokens
# count against `max_tokens`, and the cap can therefore fire BEFORE ANY ANSWER
# TEXT EXISTS. Measured against the live API, `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` spent 49 of
# 50 completion tokens on reasoning for a trivial one-number reply. Arm B died
# on exactly this:
#
#     UnexpectedModelBehavior: Model token limit (4000) exceeded before any
#     response was generated.
#
# THE FAILURE WAS ARM-ASYMMETRIC, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS A CONFOUND AND NOT JUST
# A BUG. The cap is nominally uniform, but it killed only arm B — the arm whose
# larger prompt induced the longest reasoning. A cap that preferentially kills
# whichever arm carries the most context biases the comparison this experiment
# exists to make.

# ── The uniform per-task runaway guard ──────────────────────────────────
#
# THIS WAS GOTTEN WRONG ONCE ALREADY, ONE LEVEL UP (N1): an earlier version
# derived `total_tokens_limit` from a dollar figure (`per_task_usd`). Cost is
# a REPORTED OUTCOME of this experiment ("arm B costs more per turn than arm
# A" is one of the findings it exists to produce), not a quantity to
# equalise across arms by capping it uniformly in dollars — dollars-per-turn
# is exactly the dimension that differs across arms (arm B's system prompt
# alone carries the full manual + payments-readme text on every single
# turn), so a dollar-derived cap produces a wildly non-uniform *iteration*
# budget and bites hardest on the arm carrying the most context. Measured:
# at a $1.00 dollar-derived cap, `gpt-5.6-sol` x `manual_prompt` cleared only
# ~16.4 of the ~26 requests `tool_calls_limit=25` implies needing — the
# uniform iteration control was not actually uniform once translated through
# a per-model dollar figure.
#
# The fix is to express the guard in the dimension it must not interfere
# with: tokens, sized off the iteration budget it must never bind before —
# not off a dollar figure at all.
#
# REQUEST_BUDGET: the iteration budget `tool_calls_limit=max_tool_calls`
# implies (its 25 tool-call turns plus one final answer-only turn), plus a
# flat margin.
REQUEST_BUDGET: int = MAX_TOOL_CALLS + 5

# MAX_ARM_FLOOR: the largest of the three arms' measured per-request input
# floors — arm B (`manual_prompt`), whose system prompt carries the manual +
# payments-readme text verbatim on every turn (~6,096 tokens measured;
# rounded up here). Sizing off the WORST arm, not an average or the
# cheapest, is what makes the guard actually uniform across arms: every arm
# and every model shares the one `TOKEN_BUDGET` below, so none is
# disadvantaged by carrying more context than another.
MAX_ARM_FLOOR: int = 6_100

# GROWTH: a request does not cost merely MAX_ARM_FLOOR again on every turn —
# the full conversation so far (every prior tool call and tool return) is
# resent as input on each request under this API family, so real
# consumption grows with turn count rather than staying flat at the floor.
# RAISED FROM 4x AFTER THE FIRST SMOKE RUN (F6). 4x was "a deliberately blunt
# safety multiplier", never measured. Measured growth is ARM-DEPENDENT, because
# a tool return's size is a property of the arm's tools:
#
#     schema_only     5,807 tokens/request   0.95x the 6,100 floor
#     manual_prompt  11,844 tokens/request   1.94x
#     contract       45,977 tokens/request   7.54x
#
# At GROWTH=4 the consequence was the exact confound N1 above claims to have
# removed: `TOKEN_BUDGET` (732,000) bound arm C at 22 tool calls while arm A ran
# to 28. The token guard — not `tool_calls_limit` — became the binding iteration
# control, and it bound EARLIEST FOR THE ARM CARRYING THE MOST CONTEXT. Moving
# the guard out of dollars and into tokens was necessary but not sufficient: a
# guard uniform in tokens is still non-uniform in iterations whenever growth
# differs by arm.
#
# Two changes restore the intended property. `dce/arms.py`'s `MAX_ROWS` (cut
# 1,000 -> 50) attacks arm C's growth at its root, and 12x here — the worst
# observed 7.54x with a 1.6x margin — sizes the guard so it cannot bind before
# `tool_calls_limit` does for any arm. `tool_calls_limit` is once again the
# single uniform iteration control; this is a runaway stop and nothing more.
GROWTH: int = 12

# TOKEN_BUDGET is the uniform runaway guard itself: sized off the iteration
# budget, the worst arm's floor, and a growth margin — not off a dollar
# figure, and not per-model. It is deliberately generous: `--max-spend` at
# the sweep level is the real money bound (arm-agnostic, unlike this), and a
# per-task guard exists only to stop one pathological task, not to budget
# the run. If it ever fires, that row is a visible `hit_limit`, inspectable
# and re-runnable at a higher budget — a far better failure mode than a
# guard so tight it fires during normal operation and gets mistaken for the
# thing under test being worse. See `_token_budget_usd` for what this
# implies in dollars per model — reported for visibility, not driving the
# limit.
TOKEN_BUDGET: int = REQUEST_BUDGET * MAX_ARM_FLOOR * GROWTH

# A quarter of `TOKEN_BUDGET` — N2's per-request input bound, uniform across
# every arm/model for the same reason `TOKEN_BUDGET` itself is. One

# consume the whole thing (or more, pre-N2) at once.

    calls `record_retry` — its handler treats reporting that a query WOULD be
    blocked as a completed inspection, not a governance block of the
    `inspect_query` call itself, and returns an "ok"-outcome payload
    (`{"valid": false, "violations": [...], ...}`) even when the SQL it
    inspected is invalid. So `ContractSession` genuinely does not expose an
    `inspect_query` rejection count under any name — there is no
    `rejected_queries` attribute, and no other counter tracks it either.

    This is advice, not enforcement — see `run_task`'s `enforcement_blocks`

    `cost_limit` cannot be trusted for any of our four pinned model ids.

    pydantic-ai derives `RunUsage.cost` from `genai-prices`, which raises
    `LookupError` for every one of `dce.pricing.MODELS`' ids under the
    `openrouter` provider (verified directly, and re-verified here on every
    import): none of them are real OpenRouter model snapshots, being pinned
    synthetic ids for this experiment (see `dce/pricing.py`'s module
    docstring). pydantic-ai's own response to that lookup failure is a
    `CostNotFoundWarning`, not an error — `cost_limit` then silently never
    fires, and a pathological task can spend arbitrarily far past
    `per_task_usd`. `run_task` works around this with the fixed, token-based
    `TOKEN_BUDGET` (above) as the real runaway guard, rather than trusting
    `cost_limit` to do anything.

    This assertion is the tripwire for that assumption changing: if a future
    `genai-prices` release ever adds pricing data for one of these ids,
    `cost_limit` would start being enforced for *that* model while staying
    dead for the other three — a brand-new asymmetry across arms/models that
    `TOKEN_BUDGET` was sized without accounting for. Raising loudly here,
    once, at import time, means that day is a deliberate code change instead
    of a silent shift in what "capped at `per_task_usd`" actually means.

    A tripwire must never be able to bring down the thing it is watching.
    `genai-prices` is only a *transitive* dependency (pulled in by
    `pydantic-ai-slim`, not declared here), so importing it at module scope
    without a fallback would make `import dce.agent` — and therefore the
    whole sweep — fail outright the day a pydantic-ai release drops it or
    renames it. A missing `genai_prices` is silently treated as "cannot
    disprove `TOKEN_BUDGET`'s reason for existing", not as this assertion's
    problem to raise about. Likewise, `calc_price`'s failure mode is only
    documented as `LookupError` today; catching bare `Exception` here means
    a future release raising some other exception type for the same "can't
    price this" case still reads as "still unpriceable" rather than crashing
    every import — only a genuinely *successful*, exception-free
    `calc_price` call is treated as news worth stopping the run for.

    """Build the agent for a `route="litellm_anthropic"` model.

    A SECOND WIRE PROTOCOL, NOT A SECOND BASE URL. These models are Anthropic
    models reached through an enterprise LiteLLM gateway, and they are
    built on `AnthropicModel` (the Messages API) rather than `OpenAIChatModel`.
    The gateway does expose an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` route
    that works, and taking it would have been a one-line change — it was
    measured and rejected, for a reason that is about validity and not
    convenience:

    **Anthropic prompt caching requires explicit `cache_control` breakpoints**,
    which OpenRouter injects for Anthropic models and the gateway's
    OpenAI-compatible route does not. Measured over that route: zero
    `cache_read_input_tokens` on every request. Replaying `results/sol-full.jsonl`
    — the same $2/$10 rates as this model — with every input token billed fresh
    puts a full sweep at $196.63 against $72.36, and, fatally, the penalty is
    ARM-DEPENDENT: 1.86x on `schema_only` against 3.40x on `manual_prompt`. A
    cost column skewed by a factor that varies with how much context an arm
    carries measures the route's caching policy rather than the arms — which is
    precisely the confound `README.md`'s smoke-run check exists to catch, and
    it would have been baked in rather than merely observed. Verified on this
    route instead: 5,677 cache-read tokens within one run.

    THREE PARAMETERS THE OPENROUTER PATH SENDS ARE NOT SENT HERE. The gateway
    fronts Bedrock, which rejects `temperature` at anything but 1 (HTTP 400,
    "Only temperature=1 is supported"), rejects `seed` outright ("bedrock does
    not support parameters: ['seed']"), and rejects OpenRouter's nested
    `reasoning: {effort: ...}` body ("Extra inputs are not permitted"). The
    first two mean BOTH of this harness's determinism controls are unavailable
    for this model and its runs are correspondingly less reproducible than the
    other four — a caveat for any writeup, stamped on every row via
    `supports_temperature`. The third is replaced by a native thinking budget.

    Everything the arms share — `retries`, the token guard, the tool-call cap,
    `max_tokens` — is held identical to the OpenRouter path, because those are
    the controls that keep the arm comparison honest and they are not
    route-specific.

#: Whether the `litellm_openai` route asks qwen to think.
#:
#: THIS IS A ROUTE CONTROL, NOT AN EFFORT LEVEL, and the distinction is the
#: whole reason `reasoning_effort_for` stamps this route differently. The other
#: five models take a graded effort ("medium"); qwen3.6 takes a BOOLEAN through
#: vLLM's chat template, so there is no "medium" to translate `REASONING_EFFORT`
#: into and inventing one would be exactly the quiet fiction `dce.pricing`'s
#: docstring warns about.
#:
#: The gateway's own model config pins `enable_thinking: false`, so the DEFAULT
#: for this model is thinking OFF -- measured 2026-09-04, three requests with no
#: `chat_template_kwargs` returned 0 characters of reasoning, and three with
#: this set to `false` did the same. Sending `true` overrides the gateway pin
#: and the reasoning comes back in `reasoning_content` (450/327/329 characters
#: over three requests, across all three replicas). An earlier note in this
#: team's records said the gateway overrode request-level `enable_thinking`
#: outright; that is no longer true, and it was re-measured rather than
#: inherited.
#:
#: Set `True` so this model reasons like the other five rather than being the
#: one arm-comparison run at a different cognitive setting. The known risk is
#: qwen-specific and settled empirically by the smoke run, not by argument:
#: Qwen3 has a documented failure mode where tool calls are dropped in thinking
#: mode (QwenLM/Qwen3#1817). If the smoke run shows tool-call damage, flip this
#: to `False`, and say so in FINDINGS rather than quietly rerunning.

    """Build the agent for a `route="litellm_openai"` model.

    A THIRD ROUTE, AND THE ONE WITH THE FEWEST GUARANTEES. This is the same
    enterprise LiteLLM gateway `_litellm_anthropic_agent` talks to, but its
    OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` route, serving a self-hosted vLLM
    deployment. It is the same WIRE PROTOCOL as the OpenRouter path — hence
    `OpenAIChatModel` — reached through a plain `OpenAIProvider` instead, which
    is why it cannot reuse that factory: `OpenRouterProvider` hardcodes
    OpenRouter's base URL, and the `provider.order` / `allow_fallbacks` pin in
    that path's `extra_body` is OpenRouter vocabulary this gateway does not
    understand and would ignore.

    WHAT THAT COSTS US, STATED PLAINLY. The alias fans out across three vLLM
    replicas running two different builds (see this model's `dce.pricing`
    entry), and there is no endpoint pin available to stop it. The OpenRouter
    path turns an unhonourable pin into an HTTP 404; here the equivalent event
    is invisible except in `system_fingerprint`. This is a fidelity caveat on
    this model's rows, uniform across arms — so it weakens reproducibility
    rather than biasing the arm contrast, the same shape of caveat
    `claudesonnet5` carries for its missing determinism controls.

    THE CACHING QUESTION THE ANTHROPIC ROUTE HAD TO ANSWER DOES NOT ARISE.
    That route exists because the gateway's OpenAI-compatible route injects no
    `cache_control` and so bills every input token fresh at an ARM-DEPENDENT
    multiple. Here that confound cannot occur: this model's input is metered at
    $0.00/MTok and it has no cache tier at all, so there is no discount for a
    route to forfeit and no arm for a forfeit to fall on unevenly. Every row's
    `cached_tokens` is an honest 0.

    Everything the arms share — `retries`, `max_tokens`, `timeout`, the token
    guard, the tool-call cap — is held identical to both other routes, because
    those are the controls that keep the arm comparison honest and they are not
    route-specific.
