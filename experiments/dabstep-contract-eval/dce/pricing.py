"""Pinned model snapshots, their pinned OpenRouter endpoints, and their prices.

Prices are USD per 1M tokens, recorded 2026-08-30 from
`/api/v1/models/<id>/endpoints` — from THE PINNED ENDPOINT, not from the model
card's headline rate. That distinction is the whole point of this module.

An unpinned model id would let OpenRouter silently re-point to a new snapshot
mid-sweep. An unpinned ENDPOINT does the same thing one level down, and is
worse for being invisible: one model id fans out to many endpoints that differ
in quantization, price, and context window, and routing is chosen PER REQUEST.
Measured — two identical back-to-back calls to `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` were served
by Z.AI and then DeepInfra.

The spread is not a rounding error:

    deepseek-v4-flash-0731   $0.03 - $0.44 / 1M input   (14.7x, 30 endpoints)
    deepseek-v4-pro-0813     $0.58 - $1.32 / 1M input   (2.3x,  16 endpoints)
    glm-5.3-flash            $0.05 - $0.15 / 1M input   (3.0x,  20 endpoints)
    gpt-5.6-sol              $1.00 - $5.50 / 1M input   (5.5x,   7 endpoints)

So `provider_tag` and the three prices belong to one another and must move
together; changing the pin without repricing silently corrupts every `usd` in a
results file. `tests/test_pricing.py` asserts they stay consistent.

NOT EVERY MODEL HERE IS AN OPENROUTER MODEL. Two are served by an enterprise
LiteLLM gateway instead, on two DIFFERENT wire protocols —
`claudesonnet5` over Anthropic's own Messages API, `qwen3.6-27b` over the
OpenAI-compatible one — and `ModelSpec.route` says which a spec needs.
Everything above about pinning still applies to both, but both pins are weaker
than an OpenRouter one and they are weak for different reasons; read each
entry's own comment rather than assuming the OpenRouter reasoning transfers.
