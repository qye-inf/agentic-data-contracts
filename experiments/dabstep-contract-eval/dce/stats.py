"""Offline statistics over the results JSONL.

DEDUP: `report()` and every other reader of the results file MUST go
through `dce.runner.latest_rows` -- never read `path` line by line -- before
counting anything. A retried unit leaves several rows for one
`(task_id, arm, model)` key in the raw file; `latest_rows` keeps only the
last row written per key. `load()` below is a thin, explicit wrapper around
it so every scoring function in this module goes through the same door.

The measured consequence depends on which accuracy view is affected. SCORED
accuracy is unaffected by a harness-verdict duplicate on its own (a
`construction_error` never enters that fraction's numerator or denominator,
deduplicated or not) -- but STRICT accuracy treats every raw row as a wrong
answer unless it is `"correct"`, so three stale `construction_error` rows
plus one real, later success reads as STRICT 1/4 = 25% under a naive
line-by-line reader, instead of the true STRICT 1/1 = 100% once deduplicated
(see `dce.runner.latest_rows`'s own docstring for the full case). A
duplicated pair of *answer* verdicts -- e.g. a `--retry error` resume that
produced two `correct` rows for the same key -- would double count in
SCORED too; `latest_rows` fixes both failure modes the same way, by key.

The one deliberate exception is `_raw_rows`, used only to total real billed
spend across every attempt including superseded ones -- see the COST
section below.

VERDICTS: the file carries seven, not two. `correct` and `incorrect` are
*answers* -- the model produced something and it was graded. The other
five -- `hit_limit`, `error`, `scoring_error`, `post_run_error`,
`construction_error` -- are harness outcomes: the model was capped, the
call raised, scoring itself raised, our post-call bookkeeping raised, or
the agent never got built. Two of those five (`post_run_error`,
`construction_error`) are *our* bugs, not the arm under test's; folding
any of the five into "wrong answer" attributes a harness defect to the arm.

Because of that, every accuracy figure below is reported two ways rather
than one:

  * SCORED accuracy: `correct` / (`correct` + `incorrect`) -- harness
    failures dropped from both halves of the fraction entirely.
  * STRICT accuracy: `correct` / all GRADED rows -- harness failures counted
    as wrong. Rows for a task with no gold are not graded rows; see
    `_is_ungolded`.

Excluding harness failures (SCORED) flatters whichever arm fails most;
counting them as wrong (STRICT) instead punishes that arm for what may be
our bug, not its answer. Reporting only one hides which failure mode is in
play, so both are always printed side by side, along with each arm's raw
failure breakdown (counts AND rates), and `report()` flags an arm as
HARNESS-LIMITED when its harness-failure RATE (harness rows / all rows)
reaches `HARNESS_FAILURE_RATE_THRESHOLD` -- a direct rate threshold, not
the SCORED/STRICT point-estimate gap. The gap is algebraically
`scored_accuracy * failure_rate`, so an arm that is mostly broken but also
scores 0% on what little it did answer produces a near-zero gap despite
being the arm most likely to be unreliable, and two arms with identical
failure rates but different accuracy would get opposite flags purely from
the multiplication -- both wrong. The rate alone tracks brokenness, not
brokenness confounded with skill. This flag is what `FINDINGS.md` is
required to repeat, not something a human has to notice by comparing two
numbers.

GOVERNANCE: `db_corrupted` is the experiment's headline governance finding
(did an ungoverned arm mutate the warehouse -- see `dce.runner`'s module
docstring) and is surfaced per arm/model slice: a count of rows where it is
`True` (the working copy really was mutated) and, separately, a count
where it is `None`/absent (the integrity check itself was untrustworthy --
a failed check or a leaked connection, per `dce.runner`'s own handling --
which is a materially different and more serious statement than "clean"
and must never be silently folded into a `False`-shaped default).

McNemar is the right significance test because every arm sees every task --
the comparison is paired, not independent samples. Its discordant-pair
count is reported alongside every p-value it produces. Near the ceiling,
discordant pairs get scarce and power drops fast, but that only matters for
a result that is ALREADY non-significant: a significant p-value from a
handful of discordant pairs (six is enough for p<0.05 on an exact two-sided
binomial test) is a real finding, not a low-power one, and must not be
undercut by a blanket warning. `mcnemar()`'s `low_power` flag is therefore
gated on both a small discordant count (`< LOW_POWER_DISCORDANT_THRESHOLD`)
AND a non-significant p-value (`>= 0.05`) -- exactly the case where "could
not tell" is the honest reading, as opposed to "no effect", which a
significant result already rules out regardless of how few pairs produced
it. Every McNemar comparison is run in both the SCORED view (harness-
failure tasks dropped from the pairing for both arms) and the STRICT view
(a harness failure counts as a wrong answer for whichever arm hit it), for
the same reason accuracy is: a harness bug on one arm's task must not
silently read as that arm losing a paired comparison it never actually
lost.

THE PRIMARY, pre-registered test is arm B vs arm C on `PRIMARY_MODEL`,
paired McNemar, over the reconstructed-gold task set. `report()` prints it
first and labelled as such. Every other comparison this module produces --
arm A, the other models, the level strata -- is secondary and exploratory,
and is printed under that label, never mixed in with the primary result.
Naming one confirmatory test in advance is what keeps the result from
being a search: this design runs 4 arms x 4 pinned models x 2 levels worth of
possible comparisons, and at that count something crosses p<0.05 by chance
alone.

Arm names are unpacked from `dce.arms.ARMS` rather than hardcoded, so a
rename or reorder there is picked up automatically instead of this module
silently comparing against an arm name that no longer exists (which would
read as "no rows for that arm" rather than an error).

COST: two figures are reported per arm/model slice, never `usd_guard`
(the spend cap's own pessimistic ledger -- see `dce.agent.build_result_row`
and `dce.runner._construction_error_row` -- which deliberately overstates
real spend and must never be printed as a cost). `usd_final` sums `usd`
over the deduplicated rows -- what the LAST attempt for each key cost.
`usd_total_billed` sums `usd` over every raw row ever written for that
slice, superseded attempts included -- what was actually charged. The two
differ whenever a paid attempt (a priced `error`, say) was retried into a
free-er success: reporting only `usd_final` would silently drop that
earlier, real charge, understating spend the way `dce.runner.
real_spent_so_far` (which this module's `usd_total_billed` mirrors,
per-slice rather than file-wide) is specifically designed not to.

INSTRUMENTATION: every slice also reports the per-row means of the counts
`dce.agent.build_result_row` writes -- `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
`cached_tokens`, `turns` -- because three commitments depend on them and
nothing else in this repo reads them.

`cached_tokens` per arm is a GATE, not a curiosity, and it has to be read
AT the smoke run rather than after the sweep: arm B carries all 22k chars
of `manual.md` in its system prompt, so if OpenRouter prompt-caches that
arm and not the others, the cost comparison between arms is measuring the
provider's caching policy rather than the arms. `dce.pricing` DOES apply a
discounted `price_cached` rate (5x-30x below `price_in`) to the real
`cache_read_tokens`, so differential caching flows straight into `usd_final`
and `usd_total_billed` -- the dollar figures are caching-SENSITIVE, and this
counter is how you tell whether the arms were cached differently. (An earlier
version of this paragraph claimed the opposite, from a time when `pricing`
billed every cached token at the full input rate.)

The three governed-arm counters (`inspect_rejections`, `enforcement_blocks`,
`retry_prompts`) are reported for `contract` and `contract_hollow`, since the
two ungoverned arms have no contract to enforce and would report a structural
zero.
They are DESCRIPTIVE INSTRUMENTATION -- how often the governed tools
refused something -- and are labelled as such in the output. They are not
a governance result: a block is not evidence that the block was necessary,
and none of them enters an accuracy figure, a McNemar table, or any
pre-registered comparison.

Rows are read with `.get(..., default)` throughout, matching
`dce.runner`'s own readers (e.g. `spent_so_far`'s `usd_guard`/`usd`
fallback) -- an older row shape missing a newer field must degrade to a
sane default rather than raise mid-report.
