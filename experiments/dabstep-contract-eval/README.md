# DABStep Contract-Context Eval

A four-arm ablation measuring whether contract-delivered context beats a
manual-in-prompt baseline and a schema-only floor on the
[DABStep](https://huggingface.co/datasets/adyen/DABstep) benchmark.

The design spec and implementation plan were process scaffolding under
`docs/superpowers/`, removed once the work shipped; they remain in git history.
Results and conclusions: **[`FINDINGS.md`](FINDINGS.md)** — glm-5.3-flash,
401 tasks, **four arms, 1,604 runs**, complete. The fourth arm
(`contract_hollow`) is the ablation that separates contract *content*
from contract *tooling*.

**Read the [Money](#money-read-this-before-the-first-paid-run) section before
the first paid run.** The reservation arithmetic is the single most surprising
thing about this harness: a `--max-spend` that looks generous can write zero
rows and exit 2.

## Setup

```bash
cd experiments/dabstep-contract-eval
uv sync
uv run pytest -q                     # 387 tests, deterministic and offline
uv run python -m dce.prepare         # downloads DABStep, builds the DuckDB, reconstructs golds
```

`dce.prepare` is the only step that touches the network. It writes everything
under `data/`, which is gitignored — nothing it produces is committed, so it
has to be re-run in a fresh checkout.

```
python -m dce.prepare [--threshold 0.75]
```

`--threshold` is the plurality share required to accept a reconstructed gold.
The default, `0.75`, is the pre-registered value. Any other value is a
**sensitivity run**: it writes `data/golds_threshold_<t>.json` instead of
`data/golds.json`, and the runner refuses to score against it. Run it at
`0.60` and `0.90` to produce the sensitivity table FINDINGS requires; the
per-`level` gold coverage FINDINGS also requires is printed on every run.

## The API key

The runner reads `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from the environment. Keep the key in a
`.env` that lives **outside this repo** and point `LENS_ENV_FILE` at it:

```bash
set -a; . "$LENS_ENV_FILE"; set +a
```

Never commit a key, and never write one into a file under the repo — the
sweep also refuses to start on a dirty working tree (see below), so a stray
`.env` here would block the run as well as leak the key.

### `claudesonnet5` — the enterprise gateway route

One pinned model is not an OpenRouter model. `claudesonnet5` is Anthropic
Claude Sonnet 5 reached through an enterprise LiteLLM gateway, which
fronts Bedrock EU. It reads three variables instead of `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
and the same rule applies — keep them outside the repo:

```
LITELLM_BASE_URL=https://<your-litellm-gateway>
LITELLM_MASTER_KEY=<your gateway key>
SSL_CERT_FILE=<certifi bundle + an enterprise root CA, concatenated>
```

`SSL_CERT_FILE` is not optional. The gateway is an internal host behind
the enterprise CA, which is not in certifi's store, so without it every request
fails with `unable to get local issuer certificate`. Build the bundle by
concatenating `python -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"` with
`<your-enterprise-root-ca>.pem`.

**This model is less reproducible than the other four, and the results say
so.** Bedrock rejects `temperature` at anything but 1 and rejects `seed`
outright (both HTTP 400), so *both* of this harness's determinism controls are
unavailable for it. That is a caveat on this model's rows specifically; it is
uniform across arms, so it weakens reproducibility rather than biasing the arm
contrast.

**Reasoning effort IS pinned, at the same `medium` as the other four.**
Anthropic has no `reasoning_effort` — the gateway rejects OpenRouter's nested
`reasoning` body — but `anthropic_effort` takes the same scale, so the pin is a
translation rather than an invented number, and it is sent alongside
`anthropic_thinking={"type": "adaptive"}`. Both matter: measured *without*
them, the model reasoned anyway, at whatever default Anthropic ships that day
(645 thinking tokens on one three-request run), which is precisely the
invisible drift `REASONING_EFFORT`'s comment exists to prevent.

Note that Anthropic reports these as `thinking_tokens`, not `reasoning_tokens`.
`_reasoning_tokens` reads both spellings; reading only the first recorded a
confident `0` on every row of this model while it reasoned and billed for it.

**`thinking.display` must stay set to `"summarized"`, or the traces lose the
reasoning.** On Sonnet 5 and the Opus 5 generation, `display` defaults to
`"omitted"` — `thinking` blocks come back with empty text and a signature only,
while the reasoning still happens and is still billed. On Sonnet 4.6 and
earlier the default was `"summarized"`, so a trace from an older model carries
reasoning and one from this model would not, with nothing in the data to say
why. Measured on the same prompt and model: 0 characters at the default, 456
with `"summarized"`; billing is identical, since `display` controls visibility
only. What you get is a summary — no current model exposes its raw chain of
thought.

It runs on Anthropic's Messages API rather than the OpenAI-compatible route,
which is a deliberate choice and not a stylistic one. The gateway's
OpenAI-compatible route works but injects no `cache_control`, so it returns
zero cache reads — and billing every input token fresh costs a *different*
multiple per arm (1.86x on `schema_only`, 3.40x on `manual_prompt`, replaying
`results/sol-full.jsonl` at the same $2/$10 rates). That is the caching
confound the smoke-run checklist below exists to catch, and taking the
one-line route would have written it into the data. See
`dce.agent._litellm_anthropic_agent`.

### `qwen3.6-27b` — the same gateway, the other route

A second pinned model is not an OpenRouter model either, and it is **not on
the same route as `claudesonnet5`**. `qwen3.6-27b` is Qwen3.6-27B self-hosted
on vLLM in-house, reached through the same production LiteLLM gateway
over its **OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`** route. It reads the same
three variables as `claudesonnet5` — `LITELLM_BASE_URL`,
`LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`, `SSL_CERT_FILE` — and `SSL_CERT_FILE` is load-bearing
for the same reason.

It is here to answer a question the other five cannot. Every model measured so
far is a commercial frontier or near-frontier model, so "the contract arm wins
on every model" has only ever been tested where the model was strong. A 27B
open-weights model on our own hardware is the case that matters operationally.

**Both determinism controls are available here**, which makes this the *more*
reproducible of the two gateway models: vLLM accepts `temperature=0` and
`seed=0` (verified live, HTTP 200 on each), where `claudesonnet5`'s Bedrock
backend rejects both.

**But the endpoint pin is the weakest of any model in this harness.** The
gateway alias fans out across **three vLLM replicas running two different
builds** — three consecutive requests on 2026-09-04 reported
`system_fingerprint` of `vllm-0.22.1-tp4-efbb389f`, `vllm-0.26.0-tp4-41646db4`
and `vllm-0.26.0-tp4-34e424af`. That is the same per-request fan-out this
README describes for OpenRouter, except OpenRouter gives us `provider.order` +
`allow_fallbacks: false` to pin it and fail loudly, and this route gives us
nothing. `system_fingerprint` comes back on every response, so which replica
served a row is *knowable*; it is not *controllable*. Uniform across arms, so
it weakens reproducibility rather than biasing the arm contrast.

**Reasoning is a BOOLEAN here, not an effort level**, and the rows say so
rather than claiming `medium`. vLLM's knob is
`chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`; there is no graded scale to translate
`REASONING_EFFORT` into, so these rows stamp `on:enable_thinking` (or `off:`)
and an analysis grouping by `reasoning_effort` sees this model as its own
group. The gateway's own model config pins the knob **false**, so thinking is
OFF unless we send it — measured, three requests with no `chat_template_kwargs`
returned 0 characters of reasoning, and three with `true` returned 450/327/329
characters. `dce.agent.QWEN_ENABLE_THINKING` is the switch, defaulted `True` so
this model reasons like the other five. The known risk is qwen-specific and is
settled by the smoke run rather than by argument: Qwen3 has a documented
failure mode where tool calls are dropped in thinking mode (QwenLM/Qwen3#1817).

**Input is metered at $0.00/MTok** and there is no cache tier at all
(`cache_read_input_token_cost: null`), so `cached_tokens` is an honest 0 on
every row and the caching confound that forced `claudesonnet5` onto the
Messages API cannot arise here — there is no discount for a route to forfeit.
Output is $0.13205/MTok, which makes a full four-arm sweep of this model cost
single-digit dollars. See `dce.agent._litellm_openai_agent`.

**It is served on hardware shared with production.** Unlike every other model
here, a sweep against this one is load on an internal inference cluster that
other internal workloads depend on. Keep `--workers` modest.

## Run

```bash
set -a; . "$LENS_ENV_FILE"; set +a
uv run python -m dce.runner --n 12 --max-spend 2.00 --models z-ai/glm-5.3-flash \
  --out results/smoke12.jsonl
uv run python -m dce.stats results/smoke12.jsonl
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--max-spend` | **required** | Cap in USD on the *guard ledger* across every resume of this results file. See [Money](#money-read-this-before-the-first-paid-run). |
| `--n` | `0` (all) | Stratified sample of `n` golded tasks, proportional across `level`. |
| `--arms` | all three | Any subset of `schema_only manual_prompt contract`. |
| `--models` | `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` | Any subset of the pinned ids in `dce/pricing.py`. An unpinned id is rejected. |
| `--out` | `results/results.jsonl` | One JSON row per `(task, arm, model)`. Appended to, never rewritten. |
| `--db` | `data/dabstep.duckdb` | The pristine warehouse. Each process runs against a working *copy*. |
| `--golds` | `data/golds.json` | The gold envelope. Its `revision`, `threshold` and content hash are all checked. |
| `--tasks` | `data/tasks.json` | Task list; filtered by `--ungolded`. |
| `--ungolded` | `skip` | What to do with the 49 tasks that have no reconstructed gold. `skip` is every scoring sweep. `run` answers them **unscored** (`verdict: ungraded`) — only a [leaderboard submission](#leaderboard-submission) needs it. |
| `--workers` | `1` | Task groups to run concurrently, each on its own working copy. See [Unattended runs](deploy/README.md) before raising it. |
| `--retry` | none | `error` or `post_run_error` — also re-run rows with that verdict on resume. Both already cost money, which is why neither is retried by default. `construction_error` rows are retried automatically (twice, then given up on loudly). |

**Runs are resumable and resumption is automatic**: re-run the identical
command and every completed `(task, arm, model)` is skipped. `--max-spend` is
a budget for the whole results file, not for one invocation, so a resume of a
`--max-spend 40.00` run stops at $40 total, not at $80.

Verified, not assumed: a `SIGKILL` at 142/180 rows, and separately a
hand-torn tail plus a crash loop, both resumed to exactly 180 rows with
nothing missing and nothing re-run. Every row is `fsync`ed before the next is
written, and the file is snapshotted every 25 rows to
`<out>.jsonl.snapshot`. **Only one sweep at a time may hold a results
file** — a second is refused, because two would duplicate paid work and share
`<db>.working`, corrupting `db_corrupted` for both. For running this
unattended on a VPS, see [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).

**The sweep refuses to start on a dirty working tree.** Every result row
stamps `commit_sha`, and with an editable path dependency the library under
test *is* the working tree — an uncommitted change makes that stamp a lie and
nothing in the results would show it. The output file itself is exempt.

**Commit `results/smoke12.jsonl` after the smoke run, before launching the
full sweep.** `assert_clean_tree` exempts only the exact `--out` file passed
to *that* invocation — `results/` itself is deliberately not gitignored (the
tamper-evidence claim depends on results being readable in git history), so
an uncommitted `results/smoke12.jsonl` left over from the smoke run is just
another dirty file as far as the *next* invocation (writing to a different
`--out`) is concerned, and it will refuse to start. This fires on the very
first paid session:

```bash
git add results/smoke12.jsonl
git commit -m "smoke run"
```

## Arms

| Arm | Context reaching the model | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_only` | Table and column names only, discovered through the tools. The floor. | `list_tables`, `describe_table`, `execute_sql` (ungoverned) |
| `manual_prompt` | The above, plus all 22k characters of DABStep's `manual.md` verbatim in the system prompt. The baseline to beat. | same three, ungoverned |
| `contract` | The library's nine governed tools over a frozen, digest-pinned contract. No manual text. | `lookup_metric`, `lookup_domain`, `inspect_query`, `run_query`, … |

The arms share one row cap (50 rows per tool result, applied identically),
one token budget, one working copy of the warehouse, and one task order.

**The arms are not a clean context-only contrast**, and any writeup has to say
so: arm C additionally receives 3,042 characters of *procedural* tool
descriptions from the library (`inspect_query` tells the model it "MUST call
lookup_metric first"), an arm-C-only workflow sentence, and a `SELECT *`
prohibition. The system-prompt size ratio between arms B and C is 9.77x, but
**4.41x** once tool schemas are counted — and tool schemas are always-on
context, so 4.41x is the honest number. See the spec's "What this comparison
is, and is not" section.

## Money (read this before the first paid run)

### Worst case per task, per model

Measured, including a single-request overshoot of the token guard:

| Model | Worst case, one task, one arm |
|---|---|
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` | $0.14 |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813` | $1.58 |
| `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` | $0.20 |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` | **$7.73** |

### Reservation headroom — the number that surprises people

The sweep reserves the **worst case for a whole task group** before starting
that group, and a task group is *every arm × every model for one task*. The
reservation is the permanent ceiling, tightened only by observations from
tasks that have already run — so a sweep needs

> `--max-spend` **strictly greater than one task-group reserve** to run even
> one task.

| Configuration | One task-group reserve |
|---|---|
| 3 arms, `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` | $0.55 |
| 3 arms, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813` (**the primary model**) | **$4.35** |
| 2 arms, `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` | **$14.64** |

Concretely, and reproduced:

* `--n 12 --max-spend 2.00` on **glm** completes all 12 tasks and really
  spends about $0.22.
* `--n 12 --max-spend 2.00` on **deepseek-pro** writes **zero rows and exits
  2**, because $2.00 < $4.35. Nothing is wrong; the cap simply cannot admit a
  single task group.
* **`--arms` defaults to all THREE arms**, not two. The $14.64 figure above
  is for 2 arms only (`manual_prompt` + `contract`, the design's own Sol
  comparison) — the default 3-arm invocation reserves 3 x $7.32 =
  **$21.96/task-group**, so `--max-spend 15.00` with the default arms writes
  **zero rows and exits 2**. To actually get the $14.64 ceiling, name the
  arms explicitly:

  ```bash
  uv run python -m dce.runner --arms manual_prompt contract \
    --models openai/gpt-5.6-sol --max-spend 15.00 --out results/sol.jsonl
  ```

  Even then, **$15.00 admits only one task group** before the next one's
  reservation would exceed it (`admits up to 1`) — the design calls for
  ~60 Sol tasks x 2 arms, so budget accordingly (roughly `60 * $14.64` =
  **$878.40** worst case, tightening as real observations come in) rather
  than treating $15.00 as sufficient for the whole Sol run.

Budget a sweep as `--max-spend` **plus one group's overshoot**: the cap is
checked before a group starts, not while it runs.

The runner prints the reserve on startup — read that line before walking away
from a run:

```
reserve ceiling $4.35/task-group (3 arms x ['deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813']);
$2.00 cap admits up to 0 worst-case task-group(s) before the first observation tightens it
```

`admits up to 0` means no task will run.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Completed cleanly — every pending unit ran. |
| `1` | An uncaught exception (Python's own default). A traceback is the last thing printed; no `spent` line. |
| `2` | **Truncated**: stopped because the next task group's reservation exceeded `--max-spend`. |
| `3` | Circuit broken: 5 consecutive construction failures — systemic (a missing key, a bad model id), not bad luck. |
| `4` | Connection leaked: an arm's DuckDB session failed to close, so no later integrity check in this process can be trusted. Resume in a fresh process. |

**A budget-capped sweep is *expected* to exit 2.** Exit 2 is the normal,
successful end of a run that was deliberately capped — the rows it wrote are
good, and the next resume picks up where it stopped. This breaks the usual
shell idiom:

```bash
# WRONG: `analyze` never runs on a capped sweep, which is the normal case
uv run python -m dce.runner --max-spend 40.00 ... && uv run python -m dce.stats results/full.jsonl

# Right: treat 0 and 2 as success
uv run python -m dce.runner --max-spend 40.00 ...; code=$?
[ $code -eq 0 ] || [ $code -eq 2 ] || exit $code
uv run python -m dce.stats results/full.jsonl
```

Exit 3 and exit 4 both mean *stop and look*, not *resume harder*.

## Analysis

```bash
uv run python -m dce.stats results/full.jsonl
```

Prints the pre-registered primary comparison (arm B vs arm C on
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813`, paired McNemar) first and labelled, then
everything else under a SECONDARY / EXPLORATORY heading. Each slice reports
SCORED and STRICT accuracy with Wilson intervals, the harness-failure
breakdown, `db_corrupted` counts, both cost figures, mean input/output/cached
tokens and turns, and — for arm `contract` only — the governed-tool counters,
which are descriptive instrumentation and not a governance claim.

Two things to check at the **smoke** run, not after the sweep:

1. **`cached total` on `manual_prompt`.** Arm B carries the whole manual in
   its prompt. If OpenRouter prompt-caches that arm and not the others, the
   cost comparison measures the provider's caching policy rather than the
   arms — and because `dce.pricing` bills cache reads at the full input rate,
   it is invisible in the dollar figures. This line is the only place it shows.
2. **`did NOT see the same task set`.** A sweep that stopped mid task-group
   leaves the arms with different denominators.

## Leaderboard submission

DABStep is 450 tasks; the ablation runs the **401** with a reconstructed gold
(`dce.golds`). A submission has to answer all 450, so it needs both halves of
this:

```bash
# 1. answer every task, including the 49 that cannot be scored locally
uv run python -m dce.runner --ungolded run --arms contract \
    --models z-ai/glm-5.3-flash --max-spend 2.00 --out results/glm-all450.jsonl

# 2. build the file the Space wants
uv run python -m dce.submit --results results/glm-all450.jsonl \
    --arm contract --model z-ai/glm-5.3-flash --out submission.jsonl
```

The sweep's output lives in `results/` and stays **tracked** — the
tamper-evidence claim depends on result rows being readable in git history.
Only the built `submission*.jsonl` at the experiment root is gitignored, and
that rule is anchored precisely so it cannot swallow a results file.

`--ungolded run` does **not** score the extra tasks. They reach `run_task` as
`gold=None`; a clean run records `verdict: "ungraded"`, and one that trips a
cap or errors keeps its harness verdict with `gold: null`. `dce.stats` cuts on
**the missing gold, not the verdict** — a verdict-keyed cut would let a capped
ungolded task into the accuracy denominator — so no accuracy figure and no
harness-failure rate can reach any of them. They are reported on their own
line (`ungolded: N row(s) …; M harness failure(s) among them`), because
dropping rows silently is a claim that they did not exist, and because a cap
trip across those 49 must be counted rather than hidden by its exclusion from
the rate.

`dce.submit` emits `{"task_id", "agent_answer"}` per line, reading through
`latest_rows` so a retried unit contributes its final answer rather than a
stale `error` row's empty string. It **refuses to write at all** — leaving no
partial file behind — if any task has no row, has a verdict carrying no reply
(`hit_limit`, `error`, `post_run_error`, `construction_error`), or has a blank
answer, and names them. `scoring_error` *is* submittable: it means a real
answer came back and our local scorer raised on it, which is the leaderboard's
call to make. A submission is effectively one-shot
per agent name and the Space scores a missing task as wrong, so a short file
is worse than no file. `--results` takes several files, so a fresh all-450
sweep and a spliced 401 + 49 both work. `--out` may not name one of the
`--results` files, and an empty submission is refused rather than written as a
blank line. Spliced rows are checked for provenance: a disagreement on
`contract_digest` is refused outright (two contracts is two agents), while
`commit_sha`, `scorer` and `golds_hash` differences are printed — a splice
spans two commits by construction, so refusing on that would ban this flow.

Uploading is manual and deliberately not automated here: the Space wants a
browser and metadata (agent name, model family, whether the code is open) that
should be entered by a person. Read `docs/paper-plan.md`'s *leaderboard
submission* section first — it records the conditions the submission is
committed to, including submitting one arm only.

### The submission that was made

Submitted **2026-09-04** as agent `agentic-data-contracts`, organisation
`flyersworder`, model family `GLM-5.3-Flash`, from
`results/glm-all450.jsonl` (contract arm, `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`, all 450
tasks). It landed in the `adyen/DABstep` dataset as
`data/submissions/v1__flyersworder-agentic-data-contracts__04-09-2026.jsonl`,
with per-task results alongside it under `data/task_scores/`.

| split | n | correct | accuracy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| hard | 378 | 196 | 51.9% |
| easy | 72 | 51 | 70.8% |
| all | 450 | 247 | 54.9% |

Those per-task scores are also the only external check on this experiment's
reconstructed golds, and they found a real one-sided bias in them. See
[`FINDINGS.md`](FINDINGS.md#the-leaderboard-submission-an-external-check-on-the-reconstructed-golds).

## Accepted gaps

Known, deliberate, and disclosed rather than fixed:

* **`KeyboardInterrupt` during a live model call escapes with no row.** Ctrl-C
  while a request is in flight loses that one unit's result *and* its spend:
  the money was billed, no row was written, and the guard ledger never sees
  it. Every other failure path between "the call returned" and "the row is on
  disk" writes the row first.
* **`fsync` does not reach the drive's cache on macOS.** Every row write is
  now followed by `os.fsync` (this entry previously said otherwise, and was
  stale — see `dce.runner`'s module docstring), so a row survives the machine
  dying on Linux, which is where sweeps actually run. On macOS `fsync` does
  not force the drive's own cache — `F_FULLFSYNC` would — so a laptop run
  keeps the weaker "survives process death" guarantee.
* A torn final line (a full disk, a killed write) is skipped by every reader
  with a warning, costing that one row. A corrupt line anywhere else still
  raises loudly.
* Answers are graded by **DABStep's own scorer**, vendored verbatim at a
  pinned revision in `vendor/dabstep_scorer.py` (`dabstep_benchmark` is not on
  PyPI — it exists only inside the leaderboard Space). The local fallback
  normalizer now runs only if upstream's scorer raises. Each row records which
  graded it in its `scorer` field.

  This is load-bearing, not housekeeping. The fallback was *stricter* than the
  benchmark, and on the 12-task smoke run that manufactured a significant
  result in this library's favour which the official rules do not support
  (p=0.0156 against p=0.0703). See `vendor/README.md`.
